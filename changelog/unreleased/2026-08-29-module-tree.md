# The server is a module tree, checked by signature before it boots

- **Date:** 2026-08-29
- **Type:** refactor
- **Scope:** `core`, `server`, `web`, `tooling`
- **PR:** [#543](https://github.com/Prism-Shadow/penguin-harness/pull/543)
- **Breaking:** the `@prismshadow/penguin-server` package no longer exports `AppDeps`, `buildAppDeps` or `createApp`; the `activate(ctx)` plugin contract is replaced by `Plugin { modules }`

The business surface of the server — every service, every repo, every route group, the session runtime, the terminal manager — is now a tree (`packages/server/src/platform.ts`) of the classes themselves — there is no `modules/` directory; each node is declared in the file of the thing it is. Most nodes are **components**: a service or repo class that exports itself. `@Component()` on the class — a node is named by its class, `AuthService` is the node `AuthService`, so nothing is named twice — one `@Use()` field per dependency, typed by the class or interface it needs — `@Use() private readonly users!: UsersRepo` — and injected before the optional `setup()`; the class's public surface is its interface. A **module** is the other kind of node: a class that exports *other* things, `@Module({ contributes?, context?, children? })` with `@Provide() sessions!: Sessions` fields assigned in `setup()`. Both may carry `@Bind("HostAssembly.routes") routes!: Hono` for a contribution's code half and `park()` for state. `AuthService` and the module that only existed to construct it are the same class now; the `modules/<name>/` wrapper directories for repos and plain services are gone, and so are their `Pick<Impl, …>` interface classes — a consumer names the component class itself, or declares the narrow interface it needs where it consumes it (`abstract class ScheduleTaskRunner extends Interface<…>() {}`, declared beside the scheduler). `pnpm gen:ifaces` reads the decorators and field annotations statically — never executing the file — into the same table as the interfaces, projecting a component's public members as its contract; the booter checks each class against that table (a field it does not know is a stale-table error), so the tree is checked before any class code runs, then created in dependency order. A component wanted outside a tree — a script, a test — is built with `wire(Cls, { …fields })`.

## Interfaces at signature level

A component's interface is its class, projected; anything else is an abstract class `extends Interface<…>()`, wherever it is declared. `pnpm gen:ifaces` projects every such interface into `packages/server/src/ifaces.json` — parameters and return types included, not just method names; named data types are emitted once and referenced, so a recursive type is a reference to itself. The table is generated, not committed: `typecheck`, `build`, `test` and the deploy script regenerate it. A requirement is satisfied by Go's rule: every method the consumer names exists on the provider with an assignable signature (parameters contravariant, returns covariant). A module may declare the narrow interface it needs where it consumes it; the scheduler's `ScheduleTaskRunner` is one, satisfied by the session runtime's wider `SessionManager`.

Host objects (`AbortSignal`, `Request`, a class of this package written as `Opaque<"Name">`) compare by name only, and the generator says so rather than guessing.

## Contributions are manifest data

A route group is a line in a manifest — `"HttpModule.routes": [{ id: "agents.memory", prefix: "/api/…", auth: "user", order: 190 }]` — and the module binds the handler by that id. The `http` module assembles the whole surface from those lines; adding an endpoint no longer touches a central route table. Sandbox backends and messaging connectors enter through the same kind of slot.

## Plugins are modules

A plugin package is a set of modules: `package.json#penguin.modules` carries the manifests, the default export is `{ modules: { <name>: { create } } }`, paired by name, and the modules boot as children of the platform's tree at every App creation. The `activate(ctx)` contract — `initialize` / `create` events, `PenguinInterface`, `PenguinContext` — is gone; what it registered (a sandbox backend, a workflow factory) is now a contribution or a provided interface, and what it reached (`terminals`, `sandbox`) is a requirement checked at signature level. The four sandbox backends are converted.

## The table as a page

`pnpm ifaces:page` renders `ifaces.json` into one self-contained HTML page (`dist-ifaces/index.html`): the module tree, every node's requires / provides / contributes, every interface at signature level, with the table's sha256 in the title and the JSON beside it. CI renders it for every commit, uploads it as a workflow artifact named by the commit's sha, and links it from the job summary — the page's `ifaces.json` is the table that commit builds, hash for hash.

## Compatibility

The platform node's parked document keeps its version: the module tree's documents are an added `modules` field, and the pty handle ids and sandbox settings are still written where the first platforms parked them — so a data root a newer platform has parked on still boots any older platform pushed to it, terminals and confinement intact.

`AppDeps`, `buildAppDeps` and `createApp` are gone from `@prismshadow/penguin-server`, and so is the `activate(ctx)` plugin form: an installed plugin written against it fails to load with "not a plugin package" until it is rewritten as modules. A test that needs a service reaches it through `flattenForTests(boot)` in the server's test helpers, or through `boot.tree.api(module, alias)` — a component's alias is its class name (`tree.api("AuthService", "AuthService")`); a slot is `<Class>.<slot>` (`HttpModule.routes`, `SandboxModule.providers`). Service and repo classes no longer take their dependencies in the constructor: `new UsersRepo(db)` becomes `wire(UsersRepo, { db })` from `@prismshadow/penguin-core/kernel`.
