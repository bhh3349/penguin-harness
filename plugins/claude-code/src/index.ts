/**
 * @prismshadow/penguin-plugin-claude-code — Claude Code as a session surface.
 *
 * A PLUGIN PACKAGE, not part of the harness: a deployment lists it in plugins.json and the
 * harness resolves it from the installation (see the server's plugin/loader.ts). It
 * compiles against the type-only `@prismshadow/penguin-core/plugin` and
 * `@prismshadow/penguin-server/plugin` surfaces and carries no runtime dependency on either.
 *
 * What it contributes is ONE surface (core plugin/surfaces.ts): a "New chat" entry named
 * "Claude Code" whose Session, once opened, is the Claude Code TUI running in that
 * Session's Workspace — in a pty the harness's own terminal manager holds, drawn by the
 * Web App's `TerminalSurface` renderer. The Session lists, titles, archives and deletes
 * like any other; what it cannot do is take a Task, since nothing here is a model.
 *
 * ## State
 *
 * A pty has no notion of "thinking", so this surface's state is a heuristic: output within
 * the last {@link ACTIVITY_WINDOW_MS} means running, silence past it means idle, exit means
 * idle. Claude Code redraws continuously while it works (its spinner) and not at all while
 * it waits for input, which is what makes the rule hold in practice. The window is this
 * plugin's judgement, not the platform's.
 *
 * ## The program
 *
 * `claude` — resolved through PATH and then the places its installer puts it, since a
 * machine's server is started over a non-interactive ssh whose PATH has none of them — or
 * whatever `PENGUIN_CLAUDE_BIN` names, which is the seam for an install neither finds and the
 * one the integration test uses to stand in a fake. A first prompt from the draft page
 * becomes the program's first argument.
 *
 * ## Hot swaps
 *
 * Plugin modules are rebuilt per App; the ptys outlive the swap in the runtime's registry.
 * The Session → terminal map is parked and, at the next create, each terminal is claimed
 * back from the manager by id — one that is gone reads as never opened.
