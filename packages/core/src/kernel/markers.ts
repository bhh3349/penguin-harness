 * structural (kernel/sig.ts); the class is only the handle. The generator projects the
 * instance type like any other interface.
 *
 * Two spellings, for two different things.
 *
 * **The interface declares its own members** — `@Interface()`, and the members are the
 * class's, which is where their doc comments belong:
 *
 * ```ts
 * @Interface()
 * export abstract class Db {
 *   abstract prepare(sql: string): Opaque<"StatementSync", StatementSync>;
 *   abstract close(): void;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A decorated class must be exactly a declaration: no heritage, no constructor, no
 * concrete or private member. The generator rejects the rest rather than deciding what
 * belongs in the contract.
 *
 * **The interface IS an existing type** — the base-class form, which the decorator
 * cannot express: TypeScript has no way to carry a decorator's type argument into the
 * instance type, so the members would be invisible to every consumer.
 *
 * ```ts
 * export abstract class Config extends Interface<ServerConfig>() {}
 * ```
