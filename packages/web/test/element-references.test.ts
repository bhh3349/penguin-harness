/**
 * The send-time seam for element chips (features/workbench/element-references.ts, M4.1 / AC-8).
 *
 * The rule this file pins down is the one a user feels as "the Agent fixed the right line": a chip
 * staged from a page that has since been edited must be re-resolved before it goes out, a chip whose
 * element the page no longer has must be *reported* rather than sent, and a chip nobody can check
 * must keep exactly what it was staged with — claiming a freshness that was never measured is the
 * failure mode this whole milestone exists to prevent. A source here is a plain function, so every
 * one of those branches is a test rather than a browser session.
