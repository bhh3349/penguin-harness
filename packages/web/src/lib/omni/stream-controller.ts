/**
 * Session stream controller (connect-first + dedup): a pure
 * logic module, no React dependency, driven by use-session-stream (so protocol behavior is unit-testable).
 *
 * - Phase machine: buffering (history not ready yet, events are held in a
 *   buffer) → live (fed straight to the reducer);
 * - Load epoch: incremented on every load/rebuild. The replay loop aborts the
 *   current round as soon as it detects an epoch mismatch, handing the
 *   remaining buffer off to the new round — this eliminates the
 *   out-of-order/duplication that "a rebuild re-entering mid-buffer-replay" would otherwise cause;
 * - Authoritative running state: the server sends the current task_state
 *   snapshot as the first initial event on every subscription; the
 *   in-stream task_state overrides the Session list's snapshot, and history
 *   finalization trusts only the in-stream state;
 * - resync rebuild: clears the pending-approvals table (the server then
 *   resends still-pending approval_request events on the same connection),
 *   swaps in a new model but injects the shared localDecisions set (an
 *   approval clicked on this end is still labeled "manual" after the rebuild);
 * - Pending-approvals table key = `origin + " " + toolCallId` (approvalKey);
 *   when a resent approval_request can't find its tool card (sub-session
 *   messages aren't written to the parent Trace, so the card can be missing
 *   after a reload), the toolCall carried by the event (with origin) is fed
 *   to the reducer to rebuild the nested card, making the sub-session's approval visible and decidable;
 * - Live-tail seeding: while a Task runs, `/messages` also returns `live`
 *   ({cursor, fragments} — see MessagesLiveTail): buffered partial events at
 *   or before the cursor are dropped (their content is already accumulated
 *   inside the fragments), the synthetic `partial_* start` fragments are fed
 *   through the normal reducer path at the cursor's position, and the rest of
 *   the buffer replays on top — so the in-progress message survives a refresh
 *   with its streamed prefix intact and keeps streaming.
