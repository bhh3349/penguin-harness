/**
 * The account menu, shared by both avatars that open one: the pinned sidebar's user row and
 * the collapsed rail's avatar. One component rather than a copy per anchor — the rows
 * (System settings, the dashboard, the update entry, sign out) and the dialog behind the first of them must
 * stay the same menu from either side, and a second copy is how two menus drift apart.
 *
 * Only the trigger differs, so the trigger is the caller's: it is handed the menu's own open
 * state, which is what keeps "what opening means" here rather than in two places.
 *
 * The settings dialog is mounted OUTSIDE the panel: the panel's children unmount the moment
 * the menu closes, and the settings row closes the menu as it opens the dialog.
