/**
 * Highlighting, off the main thread.
 *
 * Tokenizing is linear in the size of the file and runs to completion once it starts — roughly
 * four milliseconds per kilobyte, so half a megabyte of TypeScript is a couple of seconds. On the
 * main thread that is a couple of seconds of frozen scrolling, which is why the viewer used to
 * refuse to highlight anything large. Here it costs nothing anyone can feel: the code shows
 * unhighlighted, the colours arrive when they arrive, and the page stays live throughout.
 *
 * The protocol is one message each way, correlated by an id the caller mints, because several
 * blocks can settle at once and their answers come back in whatever order they finish.
