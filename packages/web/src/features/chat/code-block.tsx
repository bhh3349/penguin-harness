/**
 * Code rendering, in two layers.
 *
 * `CodeSurface` is the code itself: a `<pre>` highlighted via Shiki — inline CSS variables for
 * both the github-light / github-dark themes, with dark mode switched via style overrides under
 * html.dark (see styles.css), so theme switching doesn't require re-highlighting. The
 * highlighter is dynamically imported (its own chunk, loaded only once the first code block
 * appears; see highlighter.ts); before loading completes, and for languages that chunk doesn't
 * carry, it falls back to unhighlighted text. It carries no chrome at all, which is what lets
 * the Files panel put its source view and its editor on the same layer and know they agree.
 *
 * `CodeBlock` is that surface inside the chat message's chrome (visual reference:
 * better-chatbot's pre-block): a bordered box with a top bar carrying the language label and a
 * copy button. Message code blocks keep no line numbers and no wrapping — see the Files panel
 * for why wrapping is a file viewer's answer and not a transcript's.
 *
 * highlight=false (while a message is streaming) skips highlighting and falls back to plain
 * text: every streaming frame re-renders the full code with a growing length, and re-tokenizing
 * the whole block each time would be O(n^2) main-thread cost, and an in-progress highlight can't
 * be canceled; once streaming settles, highlight flips true and a single final highlight is done.
