/**
 * Conversation outline data (pure logic, unit-testable): reduces the stream items to one
 * entry per exchange — the user's question plus a truncated plain-text preview of the
 * assistant's reply — for the left quick-jump index. Also owns the outline's display
 * math: the minimum-turns gate both shapes share and the tick rail's sliding window.
 *
 * Entry boundaries: a turn opens at a user prompt (user_text / user_image) and collects
 * every assistant_text that follows until the next prompt. Consecutive user items merge
 * into one entry (a prompt's text and images arrive as separate adjacent items — they are
 * one question, not several). Machine-only texts never open an entry: handoff /
 * model-switch source blocks render as banners with no user prose, and goal rounds past 1
 * are the loop re-sending an objective whose entry (round 1) is already collecting the
 * whole run's replies. Scheduled-trigger prompts DO open one — they are real turns worth
 * jumping to, unlike in input history (which only recalls what was typed here).
 * Steering messages ride inside a running turn and neither open an entry nor end one.
