/**
 * The element picker that runs inside the user's page, and the host's half of the channel it talks
 * over.
 *
 * The picker is a script, not a module: it is serialized and handed to the guest with
 * `webview.executeJavaScript` (the main world, which the page's CSP cannot keep us out of — M1/E2,
 * E3), so `installWorkbenchPicker` must be self-contained. It imports nothing, and everything it
 * shares with the panel — the label it paints over the element, the facts it reports — is written out
 * below rather than reached for, because a reference to this module's scope would not survive the
 * serialization.
 *
 * Everything the picker reports travels back over `console-message` (M1/E4a: the one channel measured
 * to work without a host preload). Messages are one JSON object per console line behind a fixed
 * prefix, and the host drops every line that does not parse — a page may log whatever it likes, and
 * its own console output must not be mistaken for ours.
 *
 * What the picker may do is bounded on purpose (PRD FR-10): it reads the DOM and reports facts. It
 * never fetches, never resolves a source map, and never touches the page's own state — the only things
 * it changes are the highlight box it owns and the clicks it swallows while the user is picking.
 * Locating the element in the user's source is split accordingly: the guest asks the page's framework
 * *what module it is in and where* (`framework-sniffer.ts`, handed in here as an argument so it
 * travels in the same script), and the host resolves the module text and its source map.
