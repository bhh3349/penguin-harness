 * The payload (§6 of the PRD, frozen v1): what one picked element becomes on its way into the

 *
 * Two halves meet here. The DOM half travels up from the page (the picker's `ElementFacts`), the
 * page half says where it was found (`PageFacts`), and the third thing — the `refId` the workbench
 * issues — is what makes the element *the same element* next round, after an edit moved it. That
 * third thing is why this module is not just field copying: FR-06 freezes `refId` as
 * `hash(canonical source site, semantic key)`, and the hash below is that function, written once
 * and tested against a fixed vector so the id cannot silently drift into a new scheme.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here: the source half is an argument rather than something this module
 * works out (`source-resolution.ts` establishes it, the panel explains what it could not establish).
 * A payload whose source nobody resolved says `confidence: "none"` — the honest one of the four frozen
 * values — rather than inventing a location. The `refId` degrades with it: with no file to name, the
 * canonical site falls back to the page URL (`D13`).
