/**
 * Element chips and the page they came from, brought back together at send time (M4.1, AC-8).
 *
 * A chip is staged with a **snapshot**: the payload as the page was the moment the user picked the
 * element. By the time the message goes out the page may have been edited — a dev server reloading
 * after a save is the normal state of affairs, not an edge case — and sending that snapshot as-is
 * hands the Agent a line number the element has since moved off, or a style that no longer exists.
 * So every element chip is re-resolved against the page the panel is showing, immediately before the
 * message is composed: **what the message carries is what the page says now**.
 *
 * The two halves live in different components and this is the seam between them: the workbench panel
 * owns the guest (the only thing that can answer), the composer owns the chips (the only thing that
 * knows what is about to be sent). Nothing in this file knows about React, the DOM or the network —
 * a source is a function, so the rule is testable without either.
 *
 * A chip that cannot be re-resolved is **not** quietly sent: `gone` is reported to the caller, which
 * is what lets the composer hold the message and the panel say so. A chip that could not be *checked*
 * (no preview open, or the chip came from another page) is reported as such and keeps its snapshot —
 * the one thing never done here is claiming a freshness that was not measured.

 *
 * The single-element rule this generalizes is L1's: the page no longer has the element, so the message
 * is held. For several elements that rule would make one vanished card hold back three edits, so the
 * batch splits the difference — one gone element is dropped from the message and named in the panel,
 * and only a batch where **every** element is gone is held. A batch of nothing is not worth sending:
 * the message would carry the user's words and no element at all.
 *
 * `unknown` counts as surviving, deliberately, exactly as it does in L1: it means the page could not
 * be asked (no preview, a guest that went away), not that the element is gone. Dropping an element we
 * merely failed to check would be this module inventing an answer.
