/**
 * Admin server-settings routes (admin only, 403 for non-admins):
 * GET|PUT /api/admin/settings — the server-global settings stored in server_settings:
 * the proxy settings (the "application uses the proxy" and "agent environment uses the
 * proxy" switches and their shared explicit address) and the upload limits (the
 * per-file and per-message attachment caps, in whole MB).
 * A PUT applies immediately: everything is validated first (a rejected request writes
 * nothing), then the persisted values are written, then the process dispatcher is
 * rebuilt so new outbound connections follow the change without a restart (the agent
 * switch needs no push — the command-subprocess policy getter re-reads the repo at
 * every spawn). The upload limits need no push either, for the same reason: the
 * attachment validators and the request body cap both read the repo per request.
 *
 * GET /api/admin/settings/proxy-probe names the model provider hosts the reachability probe
 * would request; POST .../proxy-probe/:provider measures one of them — unauthenticated, see
 * services/proxy-probe.ts.
