/**
 * Host commands: native actions the process hosting this server can run on the page's
 * behalf, under `/api/command`. Today they come from the desktop shell — install the bundled
 * `penguin` command, check for a desktop update — and reach it over the same utilityProcess
 * port the update relay uses. A plain server offers none, and says so with an empty list
 * rather than a 404, so the page needs no separate way of asking whether it is in a shell.
 *
 * GET  /            — what this host offers: `offers`, each with the words to show, plus
 *                     `commands` — the same list narrowed to ids this build has its own
 *                     words for, which is all a page older than `offers` can safely read.
 * POST /:command    — run one; 202 once handed to the host, 409 when this host does not
 *                     offer it, 503 when the host is not listening. The id is the HOST's
 *                     word, never checked against a list this server keeps.
 *
 * Admin only: a command acts on the machine the server runs on, which is an owner's call.
 * Any admin session will do — a browser signed into the same server is as entitled as the
 * shell's own window, since the action is the host's, not the window's.
 *
 * PLATFORM code, deliberately (packages/hmr/README.md). What a host can do, what it is called and who
 * may run it is policy, and this surface is what proved the point: while it was mounted above
 * the hot seam, a change to its shape could not reach a running installation at all. What
 * stays in the runtime is the port itself — transport — published as `platform.shellFrames`,
 * whose frames are interpreted HERE.
