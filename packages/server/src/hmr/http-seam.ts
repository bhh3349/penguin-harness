/**
 * The platform's HTTP seam — the one place the runtime hands a request over.
 *
 * Without this, the route table is a runtime asset: adding or fixing an endpoint means
 * rebuilding and redeploying every installation, which is exactly what the hot channel exists
 * to avoid. The RPC dispatch route that used to stand in for this (`/api/hmr/platform/call`,
 * removed with the seam) only made METHODS pushable; a method is not a route — no path, no
 * verb, no status, no headers — and every client would have had to speak that envelope instead
 * of the API it already speaks.
 *
 * So: the running platform gets first refusal on every request, and answers `null` for the ones
 * it does not own. A pushed platform can therefore add a route, replace one, or serve something
 * entirely different, with no runtime change at all.
 *
 * Two boundaries make that safe:
 *
 * - **`/api/hmr/*` is never offered.** It is the channel a broken platform is replaced through;
 *   if a push could claim it, one bad push would lock the installation out permanently.
 * - **A platform that throws does not fall through.** It claimed the request by throwing rather
 *   than declining, and quietly running the runtime's older handler instead would answer with
 *   different semantics than the caller was promised. The error surfaces as a 500.
 *
 * The contract is one function wide — Request in, whole Response out — and a streaming body
 * rides it unchanged: the platform's SSE endpoints (`/api/events`, a session's event stream)
 * hand back a Response as soon as the stream exists and go on writing to it afterwards. What
 * the seam cannot carry is a live SOCKET, because there is no Response to return for one;
 * that is why the terminal WebSocket handshake reaches the App through in-process members
 * (`terminals()`, `attachStream()`) instead.
