/**
 * The QQ bot open-platform (API v2) seam: the app-access-token exchange, the two message
 * sends, and the WebSocket gateway, behind an injectable transport so unit tests
 * substitute a fake and never open a socket to Tencent. QQ publishes no Node SDK this
 * product can take (the one Tencent ships for the scan flow is `UNLICENSED`), so the
 * production adapter is plain fetch plus undici's WebSocket — both of which resolve
 * undici's global dispatcher per call, which is how they inherit the admin proxy setting
 * (net/proxy.ts) without asking for it.
 *
 * Wire types below mirror the platform's JSON verbatim (snake_case): the transport does
 * not reshape payloads, so a test fake constructs exactly what the real API returns.
 *
 * Two properties of this platform shape the whole seam, and every caller downstream
 * inherits them:
 *
 *   1. AUTH IS A SHORT-LIVED TOKEN, NOT THE CREDENTIAL. Every OpenAPI call carries
 *      `Authorization: QQBot <access_token>`, and that token lasts at most 7200 seconds.
 *      The credential pair (App ID + App Secret) only ever buys a new one. So the client
 *      owns a token cache with early refresh rather than making callers think about it —
 *      and the platform documents that a request inside the last 60 seconds of validity
 *      returns a NEW token while the old one keeps working for those 60 seconds, so
 *      refreshing early can never strand a request that is already in flight.
 *   2. THE GATEWAY IS THE ONLY WAY IN FOR A LOCAL SERVER. QQ also offers an HTTP callback
 *      mode, but it needs a publicly reachable HTTPS URL on one of four ports (80, 443,
 *      8080, 8443) plus an Ed25519 challenge response — the same class of constraint that
 *      made Feishu a long connection and Telegram a long poll. So this seam opens a
 *      WebSocket, identifies with the group-and-C2C intent, heartbeats, and resumes.
 *
 * A THIRD property does not live here but is worth naming from the transport, because it
 * is the reason `QQSendArgs` has no "just send" shape: QQ has no free outbound. Every send
 * this product makes is a PASSIVE REPLY carrying the `msg_id` of an inbound message, and
 * that is a budget — see qq-connector.ts, which owns the accounting.

 * One gateway session with its own reconnect loop.

 * authenticates with the same `QQBot <token>` string the OpenAPI takes (a still-published
 * doc page describes a `Bot <appid>.<token>` form — that is the retired v1 scheme and it is
 * rejected), READY hands back a `session_id` that RESUME replays a dropped connection from,
 * and every DISPATCH's `s` is the sequence RESUME rewinds to — so `seq` is tracked from the
 * first frame, not from the first message.
 *
 * The reconnect decision is protocol state nobody above this file holds, which is why it
 * lives here: a close is resumable unless its code says the session handle is dead (4006 /
 * 4007 / the internal band), an INVALID_SESSION says the resume was refused, and a
 * RECONNECT is the platform asking for the same round trip while keeping the session
 * resumable. Two codes end the session for good — a delisted or banned bot will not connect
 * however long it is retried.
 *
 * The gateway URL is fetched once and reused across reconnects: `GET /gateway` is rate
 * limited to 2 requests a minute, which a reconnect storm would spend on nothing.
 *
 * Two watchdogs bound a session that is neither speaking nor closing, because a socket that
 * stops carrying traffic without a FIN — a NAT or proxy drop, and this path deliberately
 * inherits the admin proxy dispatcher — keeps `readyState` OPEN and fires no `close` at
 * all: one deadline on the handshake (QQ_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS), and one on the heartbeat,
 * which the platform acknowledges with HEARTBEAT_ACK and which is therefore a round trip
 * rather than a write. Either drops the socket into the same fail-and-back-off path a real
 * close takes — and drives it directly rather than waiting on a `close` event a half-open
 * socket may never produce.
 *
 * What surfaces upward is only the outcome: `onReady` per successful handshake, `onError`
 * once per outage — the same contract the Feishu long connection and the Telegram poll loop
 * report, so the bridge's status means the same thing on all three channels.
