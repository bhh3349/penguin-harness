/**
 * Terminal stream transport: `GET /api/terminals/:id/stream` (Upgrade).
 *
 * Runtime, and only the transport. A WebSocket cannot cross the platform seam — a seam
 * handler returns one whole Response — so the runtime keeps what an upgrade needs: the
 * handshake itself, the Origin check, and the session-cookie authentication it already
 * owns. The moment the socket is live it is handed to the platform, which owns the
 * protocol that flows over it (terminal/stream.ts): frames, coalescing, restore
 * and backpressure are all pushable, the socket plumbing is not.
 *
 * Auth: the session cookie rides along on the upgrade request, so the same credential as
 * the REST API is used, plus an Origin check — a WebSocket handshake is not subject to
 * CORS, so without it any page the user visits could open a shell on this machine.
